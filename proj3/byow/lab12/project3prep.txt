Q: Can you think of an analogy between the process of tesselating hexagons and randomly generating a world using rooms and hallways? 
What is the hexagon and what is the tesselation on the Project 3 side?

A: In this project world generat based on hecagon, and tesseltion is kind of objects in this world

-----
Q: If you were to start working on world generation, what kind of method would you think of writing first? 
Think back to the lab and the process used to eventually get to tesselating hexagons.

A: Actually, I don't have any idea of the generation of the world in this project yet, But will figure it out with my partner

-----
Q: What distinguishes a hallway from a room? How are they similar?

A: It is kind of hexagon, but they are separated by tesselation as a block.

-----
Q: For tesselating hexagons, one of the hardest parts is figuring out where to place each hexagon/how to easily place hexagons on screen in an algorithmic way. 
After looking at your own implemention, consider the implementation provided near the end of the lab. 
How did your implementation differ from the given one? What lessons can be learned from it?

A: Not easy to figure it out the wher to palce each hexgon world, and Even tough i finish the lab, and watch the video still don't know how to start, and what i learned from this lab.

-----
Q: Consider an algorithm for placing rooms and hallways on your map. 
Ideally, consider many algorithms and think about what makes some easier or harder to implement. Try and bring those ideas together into a single simple algorithm which accomplishes the task. 
In general, algorithms with as few edge cases as possible are better algorithms.

A: I will use multiple algorithms and I hope this will make easy the life. handling th Edge cases is very hard part, so few edge case generate algolthym should be used in this project3
